//    as we will study Polymorphism
//    lets get to known what is it?
//    Poly means many and morphsm means forms.

//    it is a concept of OOPs.
//    which states that a single method in terms of java can have
//    many actions.

//    it means same method can do many actions.
//    i hope you know what is override.
//    override means when we crete an extended class (to understand extended class go thorough


//    and we declare an existing method (means method already present in parent class)
//    then after declaring we assign some to actions in it. which may be different from
//    parent class's method.

//    now, when we create an object of extended class and we call the
//    method(which is common in parent and extended class) of extended class
//    it will perform the action which is
//    present in extended class because the method in extended class has been override.


//    one more concept known as MEHTOD OVERLOADING
//    it means we can have many similar name methods but there signature must be different.
//    signature means the paremeter, and it no. of paremeter and its types

//    so, that if we want to execure an action but the mehtod which execute it has a name is common.
//    then how will the complier will detech which action has to perform.

//    action will be detect by the signature the method has.
//    the thing is all the mehtods are have same name but different signatures.
//    in terms of signature we are gonna get our work done.

//    lets see how?

    String name;
    int age;

    void kill(){
        System.out.println(name + "kill the person");
    }

//    now, as we have crated a class which will act as parent class.
//    next step is to ceate an extended class
//    extended class is vampire
//    next file.

//    NOTE: files are in sequence make sure to go with sequnce in oreder to underttant the concpept
