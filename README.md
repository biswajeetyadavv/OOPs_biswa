🧑‍💻 Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects, which bundle data and behavior. It helps design software that is more modular, maintainable, and reusable.

🤔 Why OOP?
Modularity: Breaking down a system into manageable pieces.
Reusability: Classes and components can be reused across projects.
Scalability: Easy to extend and maintain complex applications.
