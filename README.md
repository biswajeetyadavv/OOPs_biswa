üßë‚Äçüíª Introduction<br>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects, which bundle data and behavior.<br>
It helps design software that is more modular, maintainable, and reusable.<br>


ü§î Why OOP?<br>
Modularity: Breaking down a system into manageable pieces.<br>
Reusability: Classes and components can be reused across projects.<br>
Scalability: Easy to extend and maintain complex applications.<br>

üìö Core OOP Concepts<br>
1. Classes and Objects<br>
Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, which represent real-world entities.<br>
2. Encapsulation<br>
Encapsulation ensures that data and methods are bundled within a class and protects the internal state from unauthorized access.<br>
3. Inheritance<br>
Inheritance enables a class to inherit features and behaviors from another class, fostering reusability.<br>
4. Polymorphism<br>
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably based on a shared interface.<br>
5. Abstraction
Abstraction hides the implementation details of a class, exposing only the necessary functionalities to the user.<br>
