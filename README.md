üßë‚Äçüíª Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects, which bundle data and behavior. 
It helps design software that is more modular, maintainable, and reusable.

ü§î Why OOP?
Modularity: Breaking down a system into manageable pieces.
Reusability: Classes and components can be reused across projects.
Scalability: Easy to extend and maintain complex applications.

üìö Core OOP Concepts
1. Classes and Objects
Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, which represent real-world entities.
2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation ensures that data and methods are bundled within a class and protects the internal state from unauthorized access.
3. Inheritance
Inheritance enables a class to inherit features and behaviors from another class, fostering reusability.
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably based on a shared interface.
5. Abstraction
Abstraction hides the implementation details of a class, exposing only the necessary functionalities to the user.
